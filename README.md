# Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM)

Welcome to the official repository for **Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM)** ‚Äî a physics framework that replaces conventional force and field models with **timing**, **rhythm**, and **modular identity**.

---

## üå± What Is ETM?

ETM is a simulation-first model of physics in which:

- **Everything is rhythm.**
- **Nodes tick through time.**
- **Identities are modular patterns.**
- **Interactions emerge through phase alignment, ancestry, and recruiter support.**

This framework models particles, decay, and return **not by mass or energy**, but by **timing coherence**, **tick phase**, and **ancestry memory**.

## üöÄ Running the First Trial

To run Trial 001:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the trial folder:
   ```
   cd etm/trials
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python trial_001_identity_lifecycle.py
   ```

4. View results in the `results/` folder:
   - `trial_001_summary.json`: final module, ancestry, support score
   - `recruiter_trial001.json`: echo log and scoring
   - `transition_log.json`: identity transitions over time

## ‚úÖ What Trial 001 Does

Trial 001 simulates a complete lifecycle:

| Step | From | To | Trigger |
|------|------|----|---------|
| 1    | A (rotor)   | D (identity) | Recruiter support + ancestry match |
| 2    | D (identity)| B (decay)    | Low reinforcement |
| 3    | B (neutrino)| D (return)   | Strong field support |

This confirms ETM‚Äôs basic principle:
> Identity arises from rhythm, and survives through recruiter support.

## üìå What's Next?

Planned features and trials:

- **Trial 002**: Multiple nodes, echo propagation
- **Trial 003**: Scaffold module (S) and orbital resonance
- **Trial 004**: Identity return after delay
- **Trial 005+**: Pauli exclusion, spin conflict, probabilistic ancestry

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è For Developers and Physicists

This repo is designed for clarity and reproducibility.

- All modules are standalone and importable
- All simulations produce a summary `.json` file
- You can fork and expand identity modules, transition rules, or spatial layouts

If you want to get involved, start with `trial_001_identity_lifecycle.py`.
